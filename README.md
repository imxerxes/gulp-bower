gulp-bower
==========

Essentially a generator for a web app that uses gulp for building and serving, with bower for web asset management.

Aside from gulp and bower, it's not intended to be opinionated about other libraries - it's mostly the tooling infrastructure that is of interest. Other libraries are included for demonstration of tooling.

I guess it also expects you to want Sass. Meh.
